# Aequilibrium
Aequilibrium - Technical Assignment

Project created with:
- Spring Boot
- H2 in mem database
- Java, Spring, Maven
- exposed REST the operations required

Running mvn install will package the project in a WAR ready to be deployed.
From Eclipse the project can be run as Java Application or Spring Boot App(if you have the Spring tools plugin)

There are two test classes
- one is testing the Service
- another is testing the RestController

Because the time that I had was not too much, I didn't make all the JUNITs needed. If the existing tests are not concludent and you can still give me some time, please let me know.

Assumptions:
- a bigger number coresponds to a higher RANK (Soundwave si higher in RANK than Bluestreak)
